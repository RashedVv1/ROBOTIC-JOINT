# ROBOTIC-JOINT
#  Robotic-Joint (Designed in Onshape)

A CAD-designed robotic joint system built using **Onshape**, intended for use in educational, prototyping, or robotic arm development projects. This joint demonstrates controlled motion, mechanical articulation, and can be adapted for various robotic systems.

##  Project Overview

This project features a **robotic joint with 1 or more degrees of freedom**, designed in Onshape. The design includes rotational components, servo/stepper mounting points, and linkage-compatible geometry.

It can be exported for 3D printing, simulation, or integration into larger robotic assemblies.

##  Built With

- **Onshapeâ€“ Online CAD tool used to model the entire joint system.
